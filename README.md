# README
In order for the following to work, please ensure that you have the data for this project in a folder called *data* in the same directory as the files you wish to execute.

## Logistic regression

## Feedforward neural network
You can find our feedforward neural network implementation in ffnn.py. To run it, you have two options:
1. Run with `python run.py [options]` to run it on the **given data** (images with two digits). Use `python run.py --help` to get help with the options.
2. Run with `python run_2.py [options]` to run it on the **MNIST data**. Again, use the `--help` flag to see the options.

## Convolutional neural net (using libraries)
